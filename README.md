# protocompile
A parsing/linking engine for protocol buffers; the guts for a pure Go replacement of protoc.

This project is still under construction. But it will eventually be a high-powered replacement for [`github.com/jhump/protoreflect/desc/protoparse`](https://godoc.org/github.com/jhump/protoreflect/desc/protoparse).
